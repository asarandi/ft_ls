     -l      (The lowercase letter ``ell''.)  List in long format.  (See below.)  If the output is to a terminal, a
             total sum for all the file sizes is output on a line before the long listing.
     -R      Recursively list subdirectories encountered.
     -a      Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (.).
     -r      Reverse the order of the sort to get reverse lexicographical order or the oldest entries first (or
             largest files last, if combined with sort by size
     -t      Sort by time modified (most recently modified first) before sorting the operands by lexicographical
             order.


     -u      Use time of last access, instead of last modification of the file for sorting (-t) or long printing
             (-l).
     -f      Output is not sorted.  This option turns on the -a option.

     -G      Enable colorized output.  This option is equivalent to defining CLICOLOR in the environment.  (See
             below.)

     -g      This option is only available for compatibility with POSIX; it is used to display the group name in the
             long (-l) format output (the owner name is suppressed).
     -d      Directories are listed as plain files (not searched recursively).
